    <h1 >Welcome to my Index!</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Sydney Leano. I was born in the Philippines but I was raised here in Canada.
    Unfortunately I am not fluent in tagalog since I was very young when I moved to Canada.
    When I was younger, I was given the pleasure to be a scout in <strong>Scouts Canada</strong>. 
    I enjoyed it there, a lot, and learned plenty of survival skills as well as leadership skills.
    I was able to gain more confidence and social skills with my experience in Scouts Canada. 
    I have also learned a lot of social skills in my years of highschool. Through thick and thin of 
    drama and relationships and from broken hearts to lying and guilt, I was able to learn from my 
    mistakes and become a better version of myself. I've been through a lot and learned through the 
    experiences that I endured. I've grown to be a very caring person as well as a person who is more
    confident to <em>seize the day</em>.
    <br>
    <br>Fast forward to now, I'm happy and healthy. I'm no longer that 'old sydney' and am attending the school I have always wanted to go to.
    <br>I am currently in the CIT Program and have a link to my courses right <a href="../misc/courses.html" title="link to courses page">here.</a>
